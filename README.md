#### Super-Resolution Microscopy

Super-resolution microscopy techniques are so-called because of their ability to resolve structures beyond the diffraction limit of light. Conventional light microscopy techniques are unable to bypass this limit, which prevents structures finer than roughly half the wavelength of the emission light (typically no less than ~200 nm) from being resolved. In contrast, super-resolution techniques have been shown to achieve single nanometer resolution.
